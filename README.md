Endoscope Measurement and Straightening System

This repository contains the computer vision and control code for an autonomous system that measures and straightens medical-grade endoscopes. Developed as part of an MQP at WPI in collaboration with Henke Sass Wolf of America, this project aims to improve accuracy and efficiency in endoscope repair.

Features
Measurement: Detects bends using OpenCV-based computer vision.
Straightening: Uses a cold rolling process to correct bends autonomously.
Precision: Measurement accuracy of ±0.5 mm; straightening accuracy of ±1.0 mm.

Setup and Usage
Hardware: Assemble with a 4K camera, NEMA stepper motors, TB6600 drivers, and Arduino Mega.
Software: Install Python 3.8, Arduino IDE, and dependencies (opencv-python, numpy, serial).
